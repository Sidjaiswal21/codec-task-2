Specifying Analysis Question

Create a Naive Bayes Calssification model to detect sspam emails.

Defining the Metric for Success

my model should be able to predict whether a mail is a spam or not.

Understanding the context

Email spam, also known as junk email, refers to unsolicited email messages, usually sent in bulk to a large list of recipients. Usually, these types of mail have less to no infomartion or sometimes are used for phishing purposes. Now, i'll build a naives bayes classification model that can be used to detect such mails.
